Flow Storage
1.0.0

=======================================================================
Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Flow Storage is a web application built on top of CodeIgniter
(http://www.codeigniter.com). It can be installed locally on your
system (recommended) or on a public web server.


Basic Requirements

- Apache 2+
- MySQL 5+
- PHP 5+

I highly recommend using XAMPP (http://www.apachefriends.org), which
is an Apache, MySQL, PHP distribution for Mac and Windows that's easy
to install and free to use.


=======================================================================
Getting Started
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Assuming you're running this on your local machine, which is running
an Apache web server with PHP and MySQL, you'll want to put the "www"
folder into your localhost's root folder (wherever your Apache 
installation is configured to see your htdocs root) or create a virtual
domain that points to this "www" folder. If you did the former (with
localhost), rename the "www" folder to something like "flow".

From this point forward, when I refer to this folder, I'll refer to
it as the "app root" folder.



=======================================================================
Create your database
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is something you'll need to do yourself, using a tool like
PHPMyAdmin or the MySQL command line client. Either way, you'll need to
create a MySQL database, using a "utf8" character set with a collation
of "utf8_general_ci". Make sure you jot down the following info:

- Hostname of the database (usually localhost)
- Database name
- Username
- Password


=======================================================================
Configuring the .htaccess file
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Next, you'll want to edit the htaccess.txt file in the app root folder.
If you're having a virtual domain point to your app root folder, then
you don't need to edit anything.

If you're serving the application from a subdirectory from your
localhost's root htdocs folder, then you'll need to modify the
RewriteBase line and the ErrorDocument line near the bottom. Please
refer to the comments in that file for tips on editing those lines.

Finally, save the file and _rename_ the file to .htaccess. Don't
forget that period at the beginning.


=======================================================================
Editing the flow_config.ini file
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In the app root folder, edit the flow_config.ini file.

For the base_url line, edit this URL to reflect the location of your
app root folder. If you're running it as a subdirectory off the
localhost root htdocs folder, you might change it to something like:

     http://localhost/flow/

Just make sure there's a trailing slash at the end!

For the database section of the config INI, fill in the information
about your database that you created earlier.

Save your file and close it.


=======================================================================
Seeing if it works
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Now you should be able to load up Flow Storage in your web browser.
Point your browser to the app root folder (this might be your virtual)
domain or the subdirectory under your localhost domain.

You should see a welcome screen instructing you that you need to set
up your database. Click the link to start the process of doing this,
and just follow the steps. At the end, you should be told that the
system is up and running properly and you should be presented with a
link to view your Projects.

If you've gotten this far, then you're ready to start using Flow
Storage along with its companion application: Flow Receiver.
